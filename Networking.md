**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

A VPC spans all Availability Zones (AZs) within a region.
