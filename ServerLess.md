# Serverless

**AWS Step Function** lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. You can design and run workflows that stitch together services such as AWS Lambda, AWS Glue and Amazon SageMaker.

**Amazon DynamoDB** is a **key-value and document database** that delivers single-digit millisecond performance **at any scale**. It's a fully managed, multi-Region, multi-master, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.

**AWS Lambda** lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
