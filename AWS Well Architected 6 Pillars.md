# AWS Well Architected 6 Pillars

### Operational Excellence Pillar
The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to **support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operation, and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures** to delivery business value. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the [Operational Excellence Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/welcome.html).

##### Design Principles

There are five design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:

-   Perform operations as code
-   Make frequent, small, reversible changes
-   Refine operations procedures frequently
-   Anticipate failure
-   Learn from all operational failures


### Security Pillar
The Security pillar includes the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the [Security Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html).

#### Design Principles

There are seven design principles for security in the cloud:

-   Test recovery procedures
-   Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
-   Stop guessing capacity
-   Manage change in automation
### Performance Efficiency Pillar
The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the [Performance Efficiency Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/performance-efficiency-pillar/welcome.html).

#### Design Principles

There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:

-   Go global in minutes
-   Use serverless architectures
-   Experiment more often
-   Consider mechanical sympathy
### Cost Optimization Pillar
The Cost Optimization pillar includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the [Cost Optimization Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/welcome.html).

#### Design Principles

There are five design principles for cost optimization in the cloud:

-   Implement cloud financial management
-   Adopt a consumption model
-   Measure overall efficiency
-   Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
-   Analyze and attribute expenditure
### Sustainability Pillar ben vung
The discipline of sustainability addresses the long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities.
