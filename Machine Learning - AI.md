# Machine Learning AI

**Amazon Polly** - Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Polly's Text-to-Speech (TTS) service uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize natural sounding human speech. It cannot be used to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS.

**Amazon Personalize** - Amazon Personalize enables developers to build applications with the same machine learning (ML) technology used by Amazon.com for real-time personalized recommendations. Amazon Personalize can be used to personalize the end-user experience over any digital channel. Examples include product recommendations for e-commerce, news articles and content recommendation for publishing, media and social networks, hotel recommendations for travel websites, credit card recommendations for banks, and match recommendations for dating sites. These recommendations and personalized experiences can be delivered over websites, mobile apps, or email/messaging. Amazon Personalize can also be used to customize the user experience when user interaction is over a physical channel, e.g., a meal delivery company could personalize weekly meals to users in a subscription plan.

Amazon Personalize supports the following key use cases:

1.  Personalized recommendations
2.  Similar items
3.  Personalized reranking i.e. rerank a list of items for a user
4.  Personalized promotions/notifications

**Amazon SageMaker** - Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high-quality models.

**Amazon Comprehend** - Amazon Comprehend is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in unstructured data. Instead of combing through documents, the process is simplified and unseen information is easier to understand.

The service can identify critical elements in data, including references to language, people, and places, and the text files can be categorized by relevant topics. In real-time, you can automatically and accurately detect customer sentiment in your content.

**Amazon Lex** - Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text. Powered by the same conversational engine as Alexa, Amazon Lex provides high-quality speech recognition and language understanding capabilities, enabling the addition of sophisticated, natural language ‘chatbots’ to new and existing applications.
